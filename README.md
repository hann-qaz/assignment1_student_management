This project is a simple Java program.
It shows basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
The program uses classes, objects, arrays, and methods.

## Classes

It has name, id, major, GPA, and credits.
All fields are private and accessed using methods.

It contains an array of Student objects.
This shows composition in Java.
